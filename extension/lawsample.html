            SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA<br>
            COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES<br><br>
            SARAH JOHNSON, Plaintiff<br>
            v.<br>
            MEMORIAL HOSPITAL and DR. ROBERT ANDERSON, Defendants<br>
            Case No. 23-CV-8472
        </div>

        <h1>Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment on Liability</h1>

        <h2>I. Introduction</h2>

        <p class="indent">Plaintiff Sarah Johnson brings this medical malpractice action against Memorial Hospital and Dr. Robert Anderson for violations of the standard of care that resulted in permanent neurological damage. The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applies here, as the injury would not ordinarily occur absent negligence, and the instrumentalities were under defendants' exclusive control.</p>

        <h2>II. Statement of Facts</h2>

        <p class="indent">On March 15, 2023, plaintiff underwent a routine cholecystectomy at Memorial Hospital under the supervision of defendant Dr. Anderson. During the laparoscopic procedure, Dr. Anderson inadvertently transected the common bile duct, causing bile peritonitis and subsequent septic shock. The deviation from accepted surgical protocol constitutes negligence per se under Health and Safety Code § 1278.5.</p>

        <p class="indent">Expert testimony from Dr. Patricia Martinez establishes that the standard of care requires intraoperative cholangiography when anatomical landmarks are unclear. Dr. Anderson's failure to perform this diagnostic procedure, coupled with his misidentification of the cystic duct, constitutes gross negligence rising to the level of recklessness.</p>

        <h2>III. Legal Argument</h2>

        <p class="indent">Medical malpractice requires proof of four elements: (1) duty of care, (2) breach of that duty, (3) proximate causation, and (4) damages. <span class="citation">Landeros v. Flood</span>, 17 Cal.3d 399 (1976). Here, all elements are established beyond dispute.</p>

        <p class="indent">The doctrine of respondeat superior holds Memorial Hospital vicariously liable for Dr. Anderson's negligent acts committed within the scope of employment. Additionally, the hospital breached its independent duty under the doctrine of corporate negligence by failing to implement adequate credentialing procedures. Dr. Anderson had three prior incidents of surgical complications involving bile duct injuries, yet the hospital's peer review committee granted him unrestricted privileges.</p>

        <p class="indent">Plaintiff invokes the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, which permits an inference of negligence when: (1) the accident is of a kind that ordinarily does not occur absent negligence; (2) the injury was caused by an instrumentality within defendant's exclusive control; and (3) the plaintiff did not contribute to the injury. <span class="citation">Ybarra v. Spangard</span>, 25 Cal.2d 486 (1944). Common bile duct transection during routine gallbladder surgery satisfies all three prongs.</p>

        <p class="indent">The element of proximate cause is established through the "but for" test and the substantial factor test. But for Dr. Anderson's failure to exercise reasonable care in identifying anatomical structures, plaintiff would not have suffered bile duct injury. Moreover, the breach was a substantial factor in bringing about the harm, as evidenced by the temporal proximity between the surgical error and the onset of septic shock.</p>

        <h2>IV. Damages</h2>

        <p class="indent">Plaintiff sustained both economic and non-economic damages. Special damages include $487,000 in past medical expenses for emergency surgery, ICU admission, and treatment of cholangitis. Future medical expenses are estimated at $1.2 million for ongoing management of biliary strictures and potential liver transplantation.</p>

        <p class="indent">General damages include physical pain, mental suffering, and loss of enjoyment of life. The injury constitutes a substantial impairment under the Americans with Disabilities Act, rendering plaintiff unable to engage in gainful employment. Under the collateral source rule, evidence of insurance payments is inadmissible to reduce damages.</p>

        <h2>V. Conclusion</h2>

        <p class="indent">The undisputed facts establish that defendants breached the applicable standard of care, directly causing catastrophic injury to plaintiff. No genuine issue of material fact exists regarding liability. Accordingly, plaintiff respectfully requests this Court grant summary adjudication on the issue of liability, leaving only damages for determination by the trier of fact.</p>
