    <h1>Leveler Extension Test Page</h1>

    <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Try highlighting any technical term below to see the Leveler extension in action. Then try highlighting words within the definition popup for recursive exploration.</p>

    <h2>Legal Document Sample</h2>
    <p>
      The plaintiff asserts that the defendant is barred by <span class="highlight">estoppel</span> from denying the existence of the contract. The doctrine of estoppel prevents a party from contradicting a previous statement or action if it would unfairly harm another party who relied on it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The court found that the defendant had committed <span class="highlight">subrogation</span> by stepping into the shoes of the original creditor. This legal principle allows one party to assume the rights of another, particularly in insurance claims.
    </p>

    <p>
      To establish a <span class="highlight">prima facie</span> case, the plaintiff must present sufficient evidence that, if uncontested, would prove their claim. This Latin term means "at first sight" or "on the face of it."
    </p>

    <h2>Technical Documentation Sample</h2>
    <p>
      The system uses <span class="highlight">asynchronous</span> programming to handle multiple concurrent operations without blocking the main thread. This allows for better performance and responsiveness in modern web applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      The API implements <span class="highlight">RESTful</span> architecture principles, using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to manage resources. REST stands for Representational State Transfer.
    </p>

    <h2>Medical Terminology Sample</h2>
    <p>
      The patient presented with <span class="highlight">dyspnea</span>, a medical term for difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. This symptom can indicate various underlying respiratory or cardiac conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The physician ordered a <span class="highlight">serology</span> test to detect antibodies in the blood. Serological testing is crucial for diagnosing infections and autoimmune disorders.
    </p>

    <h2>Academic Writing Sample</h2>
    <p>
      The researcher employed a <span class="highlight">hermeneutic</span> approach to interpret the historical texts. Hermeneutics is the theory and methodology of interpretation, especially of biblical and literary texts.
    </p>

    <p>
      The study demonstrates a strong <span class="highlight">correlation</span> between the two variables, though correlation does not necessarily imply causation. Statistical correlation measures the strength of relationship between variables.
